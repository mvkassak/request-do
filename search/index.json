[{"content":"Going through the CTA program is intense, challenging, and full of learning every week.\nWhile I was enrolled, every week I was taking valuable notes throughout the meetings and I\u0026rsquo;m sharing them here to help in your journey as well. Feel free to comment and add more information that could be valuable to others.\nPublished Kickoff \u0026amp; Week 1 — Architect responsibilities; Presentation skills Week 2 — CMDB / CSDM; Workshops; Value of the Platform Week 3 — Architecture Standards and Blueprints; Current and To-Be Architecture Week 4 — Agile Frameworks; Technical Governance; Release \u0026amp; Instance Strategy Week 5 — Data Strategies; Instance Data Replication; Domain Separation Week 6 — Security Architecture; Scoped Applications To be published Week 7 — Security Reviews and Risk Management Week 8 — Platform Health and Performance Week 9 — Integration Strategies and API Management Week 10 — Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Week 11 — Deployment Approaches and DevOps Practices Week 12 — Final Preparation and Mock Defense Capstone — What to expect and Tips (Each link will take you to my LinkedIn post where I shared detailed thoughts for that week.)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next I\u0026rsquo;ll continue updating this page with weeks 7–12 reflections and my Capstone experience. I also recommend checking out Jakob Anker’s playlist — it helped me a lot throughout the way.\nIf you’re preparing for your own CTA, or just curious about what the path looks like, give it a read and reach out in case you have any questions!\n","date":"2024-03-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://request.do/p/certified-technical-architect-series/cta_hu_e45415cf00187027.png","permalink":"https://request.do/p/certified-technical-architect-series/","title":"Certified Technical Architect Series"},{"content":"Have you ever been stuck mid-action in ServiceNow, with the whole session frozen and unresponsive? Yeah, me too — especially when running shady scripts in the background\u0026hellip;\nWhat is cancel_my_transaction.do? It’s basically a \u0026ldquo;get out of jail free\u0026rdquo; card for frozen sessions.\nWhen ServiceNow locks up — usually because of a long-running transaction — this command tells the platform to cancel whatever is stuck, so you can get back to work without needing to refresh or log out.\nHow to Use It Super simple:\nTake your current ServiceNow URL and add /cancel_my_transaction.do at the end. Hit Enter, and that’s it — your session should unlock almost instantly. Example:\nhttps://yourinstance.service-now.com/cancel_my_transaction.do\nA Few Things to Watch Out For Before you make this part of your regular toolkit, a quick heads-up:\nYou might lose unsaved work.\nIf you cancel a transaction that was in the middle of saving or processing data, that work is gone. It can interrupt workflows.\nIf your frozen session was tied to a bigger process (like an approval flow or background script), canceling it might have ripple effects. So yeah — use it when you need it, but use it thoughtfully.\nFinal Thoughts cancel_my_transaction.do is one of those low-key lifesavers that every ServiceNow user should know about.\nIt’s not magic, but when you’re stuck and don’t want to lose your momentum, it can feel pretty close.\n","date":"2023-12-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://request.do/p/unlocking-sessions-with-a-single-command/cover_hu_e95a4276bf860a84.jpg","permalink":"https://request.do/p/unlocking-sessions-with-a-single-command/","title":"Unlocking Sessions with a Single Command"}]
