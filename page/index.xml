&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with ServiceNow since 2016, back when I had no idea this platform would shape my entire career. A friend showed it to me, I got curious, and before I noticed I was building my first catalog items and trying to understand how the platform even worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to today: I focus on Architecture, help teams design solutions that actually make sense, and try to keep things simple even in complex environments. Along the way I picked up certifications like the CTA, multiple CIS, ITIL, and a few others. I’m also a two‑time ServiceNow MVP, which still feels unreal to say out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is where I share what I learn. Real projects. Real problems. Things that helped me and might help you too. If you work with the platform every day, you know how valuable it is to find a clear explanation at the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="want-to-connect"&gt;Want to connect?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest place to reach me is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvkassak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy to talk, share ideas, or just connect with people who enjoy this world as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://request.do/archives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://request.do/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Links</title><link>https://request.do/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://request.do/links/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://request.do/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://request.do/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
