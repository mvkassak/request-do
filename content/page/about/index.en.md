## Nice to meet you!

I started my journey with ServiceNow back in mid-2016, when a friend introduced me to the platform. Even then, ServiceNow was growing fast — and I decided to dive in headfirst.  
Today, I primarily work in Architecture and hold multiple certifications, including CTA, five CIS certifications, ITIL, and more. I'm also honored to be recognized as a **ServiceNow MVP for two consecutive years**.

My focus now is to give back — sharing the knowledge I’ve gathered from communities, documentation, the old wiki days, real-world projects, and countless hours of learning.  
If anything I share helps you solve a day-to-day problem or inspires you to explore more of what this ecosystem has to offer, then I’m already happy.
