## Hey, I’m Marcos

I’ve been working with ServiceNow since 2016, back when I had no idea this platform would shape my entire career. A friend showed it to me, I got curious, and before I noticed I was building my first catalog items and trying to understand how the platform even worked.

Fast-forward to today: I focus on Architecture, help teams design solutions that actually make sense, and try to keep things simple even in complex environments. Along the way I picked up certifications like the CTA, multiple CIS, ITIL, and a few others. I’m also a two‑time ServiceNow MVP, which still feels unreal to say out loud.

This blog is where I share what I learn. Real projects. Real problems. Things that helped me and might help you too. If you work with the platform every day, you know how valuable it is to find a clear explanation at the right moment.

Happy to talk, share ideas, or just connect with people who enjoy this world as much as I do.
