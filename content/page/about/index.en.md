## Nice to meet you!

I started with ServiceNow in mid-2016 when a friend introduced me to the platform, which was already growing significantly at that time, and I took the opportunity to dive in headfirst. Today, I primarily work in Architecture and hold several certifications like CTA, x5 CIS, ITIL, and many othersâ€¦ My focus now is to share all the knowledge I have acquired through various communities, documentation, the old wiki, real projects, etc., so that others can solve their day-to-day problems and also be inspired to want more from this ecosystem!

## How can I reach out?

You can drop me a message on LinkedIn, I'll be happy to chat.
