Going through the CTA program is intense, challenging, and full of learning every week.

While I was enrolled, every week I was taking valuable notes throughout the meetings and I'm sharing them here to help in your journey as well. Feel free to comment and add more information that could be valuable to others.

## What's next

I'll continue updating this page with weeks 7–12 reflections and my Capstone experience. I also recommend checking out Jakob Anker’s [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcPCD3vMj_dbPrvy0tulscQzdBrEUNuNe) — it helped me a lot throughout the way.

If you’re preparing for your own CTA, or just curious about what the path looks like, give it a read and reach out in case you have any questions!
