# Request.do - A ServiceNow Blog

I'm excited to share that I'm finally tackling a personal project that's been on my to-do list for a while!

I will post whenever I encounter something that requires further investigation, with no set schedule.

> Let's get started! I'm eager to lend a hand and make a positive impact on anyone who may need it.
